        Who are the best football players in the world right now? A question that can never be properly answered, will barely even come close to leading to an agreement, but one that continues to fill pub chat and football terraces (well, group chats and Zoom calls for now).

A new generation of younger superstars are clawing their way into the spotlight, but the old guard aren’t done yet.

To set the criteria for our list, we’ve selected our top 10 players in the world based on personal talent and achievements across the last few of years, as opposed to a short burst of form or one-off blips  following a decade of success.
